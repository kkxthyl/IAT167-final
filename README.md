<h2>Game Overview / Storyling</h2>
<strong>Beginning Narrative:</strong> A fellow traveller tells the player that there is a mountain of rare gems and diamonds hidden away deep within an icy complex.  The traveller leads the player to the entrance of the icy complex but doesn’t enter with the player because of the dangers that lie inside.  
<br><br>
<strong>During the game:</strong> The player must travel through the entire icy complex to get to the mountain of jewels at the end of the game.  It takes three days to get through the entire complex (1 day per level).  Along the way, there will be many dangers that can kill the player.  If the player can get to the end of the final level without getting killed, then they win. 

<h2>Genre</h2>
Action

<h2>Types of Fun</h2>
Challenge, submission, discovery 

<h2>System Design</h2>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
The player will be able to run forward, backwards, jump, pick up boosts throughout the complex. 

<h3>Goal</h3>
From the enterace of the icy complex, it will take the player three days (levels) to get to the mountain of jewels at the very end, which is the ultimate goal.  Along the way, exploring the different areas of the complex and potentially getting lost within the envrionment.  If certain boosts are not collected throughout the levels, then the goal will not be able to be accomplished and the player will have to bo back and collect what is necessary. 

<h3>Game End</h3>
The game ends when the player's health has been completely damaged of when the player reaches the mountain of diamonds at the end of the final level. 

<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
The player's monement is controlled by the arrow keys, jumping will be controlled by the space bar.  When something needs to be picked up by the player in the complex, the 'A' key must be pressed.  The mouse will not be needed for this game.  
<br><br>
The HUD will keep track of the coins collected (score), boosts collected, boost meter, health meter, and how far they have left in the current level. 
Motivation design: 
There will be health boosts, shields to protect them against anything that can cause them damage, and reward badges that can be earned by surviving some of the harder obstacles as well as earning a certain number of coins (score).  Levels will also get more difficult as the game progresses.

<h2>Narrative Design </h2>
The player meets a traveller who knows of a mountain of diamonds and gems that lie deep within an icy complex.  The player is intrigued and wants to see if they can retrieve the jewels, so the traveller leads the player to the entrance of the icy complex.  The traveller tells the player that there will be obstacles and guards that the player will need to overcome to get to where the jewels are stored.  The traveller wishes the player good luck and leaves the player to explore the icy complex alone.  


<h2>Difficulty Scaling </h2>
There will be three levels.  Each level will get more difficult with harder to find boosts and coins (points for score) and the environment evolves to become more difficult.  The walls and ground will be covered in more spikes that can damage the player’s health and there will be more guards that will be able to shoot bullets that can damage the player’s health.
